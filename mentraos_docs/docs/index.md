# Intro to the MentraOS SDK

## What is MentraOS?

MentraOS is a cloud operating system for smart glasses that handles the hard parts: connections, Bluetooth, streaming, and more. This lets you focus on creating great smart glasses apps.

<div style={{maxWidth: '490px', margin: '0 auto'}}>
  <MentraOSArchImage width="100%" />
</div>

As a Cloud OS, you can write apps in JavaScript/TypeScript (with Python coming soon) and use our SDK to build for smart glasses. Our SDK enables you to access smart glasses I/O with low latency from a cloud application.

## Compatible Hardware

You'll need [compatible smart glasses](https://mentra.glass/os#glasses) to build with MentraOS.
